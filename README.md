# A personal guide to cryptocurrency, Singaporean Edition
###### Last Update 7/12/2019, 12pm

### Introduction

Hi, I'm Benny

As many would have know me, I'm a tech geek and programming enthusiast. This Guide will be just a rough overall of all the research I have done personally over the couple of days to give a rough guideline on cryptocurrency in Singapore. This only reflects what I know, not what the experts know. I'm just a noob.

> This is not a professional guide, do not take my words as it is. Do you own part of research.

### Preface

It all started around June where I was searching my way through the financial literacy ladder. To educate myself on the latest financial topics and also to be prepared for the future. And I found [Crypto.com](Crypto.com). They gave me the means to purchase cryptocurrency which is the hype these days having seen the news about [Facebook Libra](https://thetokenist.io/what-you-need-to-know-facebooks-new-cryptocurrency-libra-and-its-upcoming-whitepaper-available-june-2019/).

Knowing that I wanted to be part of this crypto game that everyone sort of doesn't really know and worry alot about the volatility of the currencies in the market, one day it can go as high as 10%, then next down by 20%. It's worrying, and as a current holder myself, I panic alot when I first started off my journey early July.

I hope this guide will give you alittle more understanding of the situations out there and provide you with the neccessary skills and tools.

### Wallets and Coin

There are many, I mean many wallets and ways you can buy cryptocurrency nowadays. Even more will come in the future. I first started out with [Crypto.com](Crypto.com). It was cool and all having an app to purchase and trade cryptocurrency. But I did realize there's a difference between the many wallets out there and how it works.

Two main kinds of wallets:
- Cold Storage wallets (e.g. [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=5c71))
- Trading wallets (e.g. [Crypto.com](Crypto.com), [Binance SG](https://www.binance.sg/?ref=35005984), [Binance.com](https://www.binance.com/?ref=37250351))
